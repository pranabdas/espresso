title: Bandstructure Calculation
sidebar_label: Bandstructure

Before we can run `bands` calculation, we need to perform single-point [self
consistent field calculation](scf). We have our input `scf` file with some new
parameters:

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import si_bands_scf_in from '!!raw-loader!/src/silicon/pw.scf.silicon_bands.in';

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="src/silicon/pw.scf.silicon_bands.in" showLineNumbers>{si_bands_scf_in}</CodeBlock>

Run the `scf` calculation:

```bash
pw.x < pw.scf.silicon_bands.in > pw.scf.silicon_bands.out
```

Next step is our band calculation (non-self consistent field) calculation. The
`bands` calculation is *non self-consistent* and reads/uses the ground state
electron density, Hartree, exchange and correlation potentials obtained in the
previous step (scf calculation). In case of non self-consistent calculation, the
**pw.x** program determines the Kohn-Sham eigenfunction and eigenvalues without
updating Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian at every iteration. We need to specify the
k-points for which we want to calculate the eigenvalues. You may use the
[See-K-path tool by materials cloud](
https://www.materialscloud.org/work/tools/seekpath) to visualize the K-path. We
can specify `nbnd`, by default it calculates half the number of valence
electrons, i.e., only the occupied ground state bands. Usually we are interested
also in the unoccupied bands above the Fermi energy. Number of occupied bands
can be found in the `scf` output as number of Kohn-Sham states. Below is a
sample input file for the band calculation:

import si_bands_in from '!!raw-loader!/src/silicon/pw.bands.silicon.in';

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="src/silicon/pw.bands.silicon.in" showLineNumbers>{si_bands_in}</CodeBlock>

Run `pw.x` with `bands` calculation input file:

```bash
pw.x < pw.bands.silicon.in > pw.bands.silicon.out
```

After the bands calculation is performed, we need some postprocessing using
`bands.x` utility in order to obtain the data in more usable format. Input file
for `bands.x` postprocessing:

import si_bands_pp_in from '!!raw-loader!/src/silicon/pp.bands.silicon.in';

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="src/silicon/pp.bands.silicon.in" showLineNumbers>{si_bands_pp_in}</CodeBlock>

Run `bands.x` from post processing (PP) module:

```bash
bands.x < pp.bands.silicon.in > pp.bands.silicon.out
```

Finally, we run `plotband.x` to visualize bandstructure. We can either run it
interactively (as described below) or provide an input file. In order to run
interactively, type `plotband.x` in your terminal.

```bash
     Input file > si_bands.dat

output file (ps) > si_bands.ps

```

You will have `si_bands.ps` with band diagram. Alternatively, you can use your
favorite plotting program to make the plots. Below is an example of using Python
matplotlib.

```python title="notebooks/si-bands.ipynb" showLineNumbers
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import rcParamsDefault
import numpy as np
%matplotlib inline

plt.rcParams["figure.dpi"]=150
plt.rcParams["figure.facecolor"]="white"
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"]=(8, 6)

# load data
data = np.loadtxt('../src/silicon/si_bands.dat.gnu')

k = np.unique(data[:, 0])
bands = np.reshape(data[:, 1], (-1, len(k)))

for band in range(len(bands)):
    plt.plot(k, bands[band, :], linewidth=1, alpha=0.5, color='k')
plt.xlim(min(k), max(k))

# Fermi energy
plt.axhline(6.6416, linestyle=(0, (5, 5)), linewidth=0.75, color='k', alpha=0.5)
# High symmetry k-points (check bands_pp.out)
plt.axvline(0.8660, linewidth=0.75, color='k', alpha=0.5)
plt.axvline(1.8660, linewidth=0.75, color='k', alpha=0.5)
plt.axvline(2.2196, linewidth=0.75, color='k', alpha=0.5)
# text labels
plt.xticks(ticks= [0, 0.8660, 1.8660, 2.2196, 3.2802], \
           labels=['L', '$\Gamma$', 'X', 'U', '$\Gamma$'])
plt.ylabel("Energy (eV)")
plt.text(2.3, 5.6, 'Fermi energy', fontsize= small)
plt.show()
```

:::info

The `k` values corresponding to high symmetry points (such as $\Gamma$, X, U, L)
which we need to label in our band diagram, can be found in the post-processing
output file (`si_bands_pp.out`).

Bandgap value can be determined from the highest occupied, lowest unoccupied
level values printed in `scf` calculation output.

## Note on bandgap

Usually, band gaps computed using common exchange-correction functionals such as
LDA or GGA are severely underestimated compared to actual experimental values.
This discrepancy is mainly due to (1) approximations used in the exchange
correction functional and (2) a derivative discontinuity term, originating from
the density functional being discontinuous with the total number of electrons in
the system. The second contribution is larger contributor to the error. It can
be partly addressed by a variety of techniques such as the GW approximation.

Strategies to improve band gap prediction at moderate to low computational cost
now been developed by several groups, including Chan and Ceder (delta-sol)[^1],
Heyd et al. (hybrid functionals)[^2], and Setyawan et al. (empirical fits)[^3].
