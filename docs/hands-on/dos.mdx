title: Density of States calculation

Electronic density of states is an important property of a material.

$\rho(E)dE$ = number of electronic states in the energy interval $(E, E + dE)$

Before we can run the Density of States (DOS) calculation, we need

1. Perform fixed-ion self consistent filed (scf) calculation. In plane-wave
based DFT calculations the electronic density is expressed by functions of the
form $\exp (i \textbf{k} \cdot \textbf{r})$ with energy given by
$E = \hbar^2k^2/2m$.

2. Perform non-self consistent field (nscf) calculation with denser k-point
grid. A large number of $k$ points are required DOS calculation, as the accuracy
of DOS depends on the integration in $k$ space.

3. Finally, the DOS can be determined by integrating the electron density in $k$
space.

I have created a new input file (`pw.scf.silicon_dos.in`) which is very much the same as
our previous scf input file except some parameters are modified. You can find
all the input files in my [GitHub repository](
https://github.com/pranabdas/espresso/). We used the lattice constant value that
we obtained from the relaxation calculation. We should not directly use the
experimental/real lattice constant values. Depending on the method and
pseudo-potential, it might result stress in the system. We have increased the
`ecutwfc` to have better precision. We run the scf calculation:

```bash
pw.x < pw.scf.silicon_dos.in > pw.scf.silicon_dos.out
```

Next, we have prepared the input file for the `nscf` calculation. Where is have
added `occupations` in the `&system` card as `tetrahedra` (appropriate for DOS
calculation). We have increased the number of k-points to 12 × 12 × 12 with
automatic option. Also specify `nosym = .TRUE.` to avoid generation of
additional k-points in low symmetry cases. `outdir` and `prefix` must be the
same as in the `scf` step, some of the inputs and output are read from previous
step. Here we can specify a larger number of `nbnd` to calculate unoccupied
bands. Number of occupied bands can be found in the `scf` output as number of
Kohn-Sham states.


```bash
pw.x < pw.nscf.silicon_dos.in > pw.nscf.silicon_dos.out
```

Now our final step is to calculate the density of states. The DOS input file as
follows:

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import si_dos_in from '!!raw-loader!/src/silicon/pp.dos.silicon.in';

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="src/silicon/pp.dos.silicon.in" showLineNumbers>{si_dos_in}</CodeBlock>

We run:

```bash
dos.x < pp.dos.silicon.in > pp.dos.silicon.out
```

The DOS data in the `si_dos.dat` file that we specified in our input file. We
can plot the DOS:

```python title="notebooks/silicon-dos.ipynb" showLineNumbers
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import rcParamsDefault
import numpy as np
%matplotlib inline

# load data
energy, dos, idos = np.loadtxt('../src/silicon/si_dos.dat', unpack=True)

# make plot
plt.figure(figsize = (12, 6))
plt.plot(energy, dos, linewidth=0.75, color='red')
plt.yticks([])
plt.xlabel('Energy (eV)')
plt.ylabel('DOS')
plt.axvline(x=6.642, linewidth=0.5, color='k', linestyle=(0, (8, 10)))
plt.xlim(-6, 16)
plt.ylim(0, )
plt.fill_between(energy, 0, dos, where=(energy < 6.642), facecolor='red', alpha=0.25)
plt.text(6, 1.7, 'Fermi energy', fontsize= med, rotation=90)
plt.show()
```

:::info Important

For a set of calculation, we must keep the `prefix` same. For example, the
**nscf** or **bands** calculation uses the wavefunction calculated by the
**scf** calculation. When performing different calculations, for example you
change a parameter and want to see the changes, you must use different output
folder or unique `prefix` for different calculations so that the outputs do not
get mixed.

:::tip

Sometimes it is important to sample the $\Gamma$ point for DOS calculation
(e.g., the conducting bands cross the Fermi surface only at $\Gamma$ point). In
such cases, we need to use odd k-grid (e.g., 9✕9✕5).
