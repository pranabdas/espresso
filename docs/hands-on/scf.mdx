We need to provide various important parameters for the self consistent
calculation (solves the Kohn-Sham equation self-consistently) via an input file.
In QE input files, there are `NAMELISTS` and `INPUT_CARDS`. `NAMELISTS`
variables have default values, and new values can be provided as required for a
specific calculation. The variables can be declared in any specific order. On
the other hand, the variables in the `INPUT_CARDS` has always to be specified
and in specific order. Logically independent `INPUT_CARDS` may be organized in
any order.

There are three mandatory `NAMELISTS` in `PWscf`: (1) `&CONTROL`: specifies the
flux of computation, (2) `&SYSTEM`: specifies the system, and (3) `&ELECTRONS`:
specifies the algorithms used to solve the Kohn-Sham equation. There are two
other `NAMELISTS`: `&IONS` and `&CELLS`, which need to be specified depending on
the calculation.

Three `INPUT_CARDS`: `ATOMIC_SPECIES`, `ATOMIC_POSITIONS`, and `K_POINTS` in
`PWscf` are mandatory. There are few others that must be provided in certain
calculations.

Below is our input file [pw.scf.silicon.in](
https://github.com/pranabdas/espresso/tree/main/src/silicon) for silicon in
standard diamond (FCC) structure. Note that Quantum ESPRESSO uses primitive unit
cell when `CELL_PARAMETERS` are not provided. One can use any other type of cell
e.g., conventional unit cell or supercell by specifying corresponding
`CELL_PARAMETERS` and `ATOMIC_POSITIONS`.The input files are typically named
with `.in` prefix, while output files are named with `.out` prefix for their
easier identification. The input parameters are organized in `&namelists`
followed by their fields or cards. The `&control`, `&system`, and `&electrons`
namelists are required. There are also optional `&cell` and `&ions`, you must
provide them if your calculation require them. Most parameters in the
`namelists` have default values (which may or may not suit your needs), however
some variables you must always provide. Comment lines can be added with lines
starting with a `!` like in FORTRAN. Also, parameter names are not
case-sensitive as in FORTRAN, i.e., `&control` and `&CONTROL` are the same.

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import pw_scf_silicon_in from '!!raw-loader!/src/silicon/pw.scf.silicon.in';

I am using the pseudo potential file (`Si.pz-vbc.UPF`) downloaded from [Quantum
Espresso Website](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/pseudopotentials).

You must read the **PWscf user manual** for in-depth understanding. Check the
`qe-x.x/PW/Doc/` folder under your installation directory. Also see
`INPUT_PW.html` describing various input parameters. PW stands for plane waves.

Run `pw.x` in self consistent mode for silicon.

```bash
pw.x < pw.scf.silicon.in > pw.scf.silicon.out
# For parallel execution
mpirun -np 4 pw.x -inp pw.scf.silicon.in > pw.scf.silicon.out
```

:::note

I have added the Quantum ESPRESSO executable directory to the `PATH` environment
variable in bash/zsh profile, otherwise we have to type the full path of `pw.x`
executable location.

Now let's look at the output file `pw.scf.silicon.out` and see how the
convergence is reached:

```bash
grep -e 'total energy' -e estimate pw.scf.silicon.out
```

and you should see something like this:

```fortran
     total energy              =     -15.85014573 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -15.86899637 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.06093037 Ry
     total energy              =     -15.85194177 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -15.85292281 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00462014 Ry
     total energy              =     -15.85218359 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -15.85220235 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00011293 Ry
!    total energy              =     -15.85219789 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -15.85219831 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <       0.00000099 Ry
     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
```

It is important to note that the absolute value of DFT total energy is not with
respect to the vacuum reference, and depends on the chosen pseudopotential. The
meaningful measure is the difference in total energy, where various offsets
cancel out.

:::note

In the above calculation, if you check the output file `pw.scf.silicon.out`, you
will find: highest occupied, lowest unoccupied level (eV): 6.2117 6.8442.
Therefore, the bandgap is 0.6325 eV, which is an underestimation of actual
bandgap (1.12 eV).

:::tip Tips on convergence

1. Reduce `mixing_beta` value, especially if there is an oscillation around the
convergence energy.

2. If it is a metallic system, use smearing and degauss. In this case, the SCF
accuracy gradually goes down then suddenly increases (due to slight change in
Fermi energy highest occupied/<wbr/>lowest unoccupied levels change).

3. Increase energy and charge density cutoffs (make sure they are sufficient).

4. Certain pseudo potential files have issues, you may try with pseudo
potentials from different libraries.

5. Suggested values for the `conv_thr`: for energy and eigenvalues (scf
calculation) 1.0d-7, for forces (relax calculation) 1.0d-8, for stress (vc-relax
calculation) 1.0d-9 Ry. For certain calculation convergence might be very slow
for the first iteration, one can start the calculation with a higher threshold,
after few iterations reduce it and restart the calculation.

There are several other important information is printed on the output file.
Exchange correlation used in the calculation:

```bash
Exchange-correlation= SLA  PZ   NOGX NOGC
```

Where `SLA` → Slater exchange; `PZ` → Perdew-Zunger parametrization of the LDA;
`NOGX` and `NOGC` indicates that density gradients are not taken into account.

We can see the total number of plane waves (1067) uses in our calculation:

```bash
Parallelization info
--------------------
sticks:   dense  smooth     PW     G-vecs:    dense   smooth      PW
Min         108     108     34                 1489     1489     266
Max         109     109     35                 1492     1492     267
Sum         433     433    139                 5961     5961    1067
```

Number of Kohn-Sham states:

```bash
number of electrons       =         8.00
number of Kohn-Sham states=            8
```

In our calculation we have specified the number of bands = 8. Otherwise, there
would be 4 bands for 8 electrons in case of non spin-polarized systems.
